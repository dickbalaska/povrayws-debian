# povrayws-debian
Debian build config for povrayws

povrayws is a custom edition of POV-Ray that replaces the usual command line frontend with websockets.
This allows other programs to capture the progress of renders.
Currently, povrayws is used by 
- [qtpov](http://www.buckosoft.com/qtpov), a GUI frontend for developing POV-Ray scenes
- [bsac](http://www.buckosoft.com/bsac), BuckoSoft Animation Controller, a renderfarm.

This package is published as a PPA at [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~dickbalaska/+archive/ubuntu/povrayws)
