Description: Persistence of vision raytracer + Websockets (3D renderer)
 POV-Ray is a full-featured ray tracer. Ray tracers simulate objects
 and light sources of the real world to calculate photorealistic, computer
 generated images. Because of the nature of ray tracing, this process is
 quite CPU-intensive, at the benefit of more realistic images compared to
 real time rendering techniques. For example, in POV-Ray, you can model a
 glass prism, and you will see a spectrum in the resulting image.
 .
 This edition of POV-Ray replaces the command line with a websockets 
 interface. povrayws nominally runs as a pseudo-service and other programs
 connect to it and drive it.
 .
 povray-includes is highly recommended in addition to this package.
